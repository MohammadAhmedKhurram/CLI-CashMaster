# CLI-CashMaster

A TypeScript-based command-line ATM simulator using Node.js, Inquirer, and Chalk. This program allows users to log in with a PIN, check their account balance, withdraw funds, and exit.

# Features

Randomly Generated PIN: Users have three attempts to enter the correct PIN.

Withdrawal Options: Users can withdraw from preset amounts.

Balance Checking: Users can check their account balance at any time.

Session Management: Users can perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.
